    <h2>
        Model Selection
    </h2>
    
    <p>This project will utilize a supervised machine learning model. 
        The target of the model is life expectancy which is a continuous variable. 
        Therefore, a multiple linear regression model will be used. The primary disadvantage or 
        limit of a linear regression model is that assumes a linear relationship 
        between variables which is rarely true in the real world. That being said, 
        using multiple linear regression seeks to minimize this limitation while still 
        retaining the benefits of this model choice. Benefits that include simplicity in 
        implementation, efficient to train, relatively simple to interpret, and while the 
        model is prone to overfitting, this can be diminished employing dimensionality reduction techniques 
        (removing multicollinearity as much as possible).</p>

    <h2>Splitting into Training and Testing Sets</h2>
    <p>Sklearn train_test_split was used to split the data into training and testing data sets. 
        Currently, the default split is being utilized with 75% of the data in the training split and 25% in the test split. 
        This may be explored more later if it seems valuable.</p>
