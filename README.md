## Reason for Topic
Each of us hopes to work in the tech field soon and are interested in health data, so this seemed like a good overlap between those fields. Furthermore, we all plan to be 
job searching in the tech field soon and understanding what factors lead to poor mental health may aid in determining what jobs to pursue.
